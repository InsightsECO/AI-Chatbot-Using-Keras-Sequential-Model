# AI-Chatbot-Using-Keras-Sequential-Model
Chatbots are AI systems designed to simulate human conversation. They use natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users in various forms such as text-based interfaces, voice-activated systems, and embedded applications.
1.1 Overview of Chatbots
Chatbots are AI systems designed to simulate human conversation. They use natural language processing (NLP) to interact with users in various forms such as text-based interfaces, voice-activated systems, and embedded applications.

1.2 Importance and Applications of Chatbots
Chatbots are crucial for customer support, e-commerce, healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment, providing instant and efficient interaction.

1.3 Project Goals and Objectives
The project aims to build an AI chatbot using the Keras Sequential Model, showcasing data collection, text processing, model building, evaluation, chatbot development, deployment, and continuous improvement.

Data Collection and Preparation
2.1 Sources of Data
We'll use the Cornell Movie Dialogues dataset from Kaggle, which includes over 220,000 conversational exchanges from movie scripts.

2.2 Data Preprocessing
Parse and clean the data, remove noise, and create input-output pairs for training. This involves extracting relevant fields, standardizing text, and structuring dialogues.

2.3 Data Augmentation (if necessary)
Increase dataset diversity with synonym replacement, back-translation, and noise injection to improve model robustness.

2.4 Splitting Data
Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The training set will be used to train the model, the validation set to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set to evaluate the final model's performance.

Data Collection and Preparation
Splitting Data into Training, Validation, and Test Sets
We will split our data into three parts to ensure a balanced and unbiased evaluation of our model:

Training Set: 70% of the data will be used to train the model.
Validation Set: 15% of the data will be used to validate the model during training, helping to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Test Set: 15% of the data will be used to evaluate the final model, ensuring an unbiased assessment of its performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Visualization
Character and Dialogue Distribution: Visualize the number of dialogues per character and per movie to understand data distribution.
Word Frequency: Create word clouds and bar charts to show the most common words used in the dialogues.
Dialogue Length: Plot histograms to show the distribution of dialogue lengths, helping to understand the variability in dialogue complexity.
Understanding the Data Distribution
Dialogue Count per Character: Identify characters with the most and least dialogues.
Dialogue Distribution by Movie Genre: Analyze how dialogues are distributed across different movie genres.
Temporal Analysis: If applicable, look at trends in dialogue complexity or length over time (e.g., across different years or movie releases).
Identifying and Handling Missing Values
Missing Value Analysis: Check for missing values in key fields (character ID, dialogue text, etc.).
Handling Missing Data: Decide on strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation, removal, or marking missing values with a specific token.
